               <h2>How it works?</h2>
               <P> Search engines use crawlers (spiders or bots) to gather information from websites and create large databases (indexes).
                The context of links helps search engines understand what a page is about.Search engines rank content based on relevance. The more links pointing to a resource, the more confident the search engine becomes that it’s relevant for specific queries.
